		<p> I am a PhD student in the CSE Department @ IIT Bombay. I'm working with <a href="https://abir-de.github.io/">Abir De</a> and 
<a href="https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~soumen">Soumen Chakrabarti</a>.</p>

		<p>  I design machine learning methods for predictive challenges on graphs, with a focus on neural graph retrieval. This currently involves developing deep learning models for solving graph combinatorial problems,  scalable retrieval methods with trainable hashing, and ensuring interpretability through explicit alignment-driven justifications.
These techniques are applicable to multimodal retrieval involving graphs from diverse domains, such as knowledge graphs, scene graphs, social networks, and molecular graphs.</p>
