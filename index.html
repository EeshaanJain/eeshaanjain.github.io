		<!-- <p>  I design machine learning methods for predictive challenges on graphs, with a focus on neural graph retrieval. This currently involves developing deep learning models for solving graph combinatorial problems,  scalable retrieval methods with trainable hashing, and ensuring interpretability through explicit alignment-driven justifications.
These techniques are applicable to multimodal retrieval involving graphs from diverse domains, such as knowledge graphs, scene graphs, social networks, and molecular graphs.</p> -->
      <p>
        I have a keen interest in applications of machine learning to life sciences, especially multi-scale representation learning and drug discovery along with geometric deep learning. 
        Previously Previously, I have worked on optimization, graph neural networks, graph retrieval, and fair learning under Prof. <a href="https://abir-de.github.io/">Abir De</a> and Prof. <a href="https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~soumen/">Soumen Charkabarti</a> at IIT Bombay.
        I have also worked with Google Research for a year, and with AWL, Inc. and Sony, Japan.
