        I have a keen interest in applications of machine learning to life sciences, especially multi-scale representation learning and drug discovery along with geometric deep learning. 
        Previously, I have worked on optimization, graph neural networks, graph retrieval, and fair learning under Prof. <a href="https://abir-de.github.io/">Abir De</a> and Prof. <a href="https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~soumen/">Soumen Charkabarti</a> at IIT Bombay.
        I have also worked with Google Research for a year, and with AWL, Inc. and Sony, Japan. 
      </p>

      <p>
        I have acted as a Teaching Assistant in the following courses:
        <ol>
          <li> CS 461: Foundation models and generative AI (250+ students) [EPFL]</li>
          <li>CS 119: Information, calculation, communication (300+ students) [EPFL]</li>
          <li>CS 419M (Introduction to Machine Learning) (100+ students) [IIT Bombay]</li>
          <li>CS 768 (Learning with Graphs) (50+ students) [IIT Bombay]</li>
